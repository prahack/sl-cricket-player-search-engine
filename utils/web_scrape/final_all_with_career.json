        "description": "Ashantha Lakdasa Francis de Mel (born 9 May 1959 in Colombo) is a former Sri Lankan Test and ODI cricketer and selector for the national team. He bowled Sri Lanka's first ball in a Test match.[1] He was one of few Sri Lanka bowlers in the 1980s above medium pace, and he was also said to have the ability to get the ball to swing out.",
        "career": "He was a brisk right-arm bowler with the ability to gain genuine outswing, Ashantha de Mel was Sri Lanka's leading pace bowler following their elevation to full Test status. In Sri Lanka's inaugural test against England in 1981-82, de Mel took a highly creditable 4 for 70 and 1 for 33. In the following tour of Pakistan, he toiled willingly, taking 11 wickets. In the one-off Test against India in 1982-83, he became the first Sri Lankan fast bowler to take a five-wicket haul, grabbing 5 for 68 in the second innings. With the bat, de Mel was a handy performer, capable of valuable contributions in the lower order with his aggressive style. A serious knee injury brought his career to a premature end after the 1987 World Cup, but he went on to represent Sri Lanka at bridge, including an appearance at the Commonwealth Games.  He also served on the interim committee of the Sri Lanka cricket board, and was a national selector and manager of the under-19 side.\nJohann P Jayasekera (April 2004)",

He is the first ODI cap for Sri Lanka, second test cap for Sri Lanka and was part of Sri Lanka's first test team.[1] He bowled leg spin, and on the tour of Pakistan in 1982 he became the first Sri Lankan bowler to take five wickets in a Test innings.[2] He was also the oldest player to lead Sri Lanka in test cricket during a test tour to New Zealand in 1983. He is also regarded as the longest serving spinner to have played for Sri Lanka and considered one of the finest leg spinners to have emerged from Sri Lanka.[3][4][5]",
        "career": "One of Sri Lanka's finest legspinners, Somachandra De Silva was unfortunate that when Sri Lanka was granted full Test status he was at a stage when most players are well into retirement. He had been a fixture in the Sri Lanka team, and well respected throughout cricketing circles around the world, having played minor county cricket for Linconshire and Shropshire. With his flighted legbreaks and well disguised wrong 'uns, de Silva was a consistent wicket-taker throughout the 70s. In Sri Lanka's inaugural Test he captured 3 for 54 and 0 for 38, his first Test wicket being that of David Gower caught at the wicket by Mahes Goonatilleke. de Silva distinguished himself on the following tour to Pakistan, taking seventeen wickets in three Tests, including the first five-wicket haul by a Sri Lankan when he took 5 for 59 at Faisalabad. When Duleep Mendis was injured early on the 1982-83 tour of New Zealand, de Silva was handed the honour of leading Sri Lanka in two Tests. With the bat, he was more than useful making two half centuries, both as captain. He maintained his prominence within the game, later coaching Sri Lanka. He was later appointed cricket advisor by the Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa in December 2007 to promote the game in the country's war-hit northern areas. In 2009 De Silva was appointed chairman of a seven-member interim committee to run Sri Lanka Cricket by sports minister Gamini Lokuge.",

He had a steady, though somewhat disappointing debut taking two wickets in each innings, bowling with admirable accuracy but failing to give the ball sufficient flight on what was a favorable wicket for spin bowling. It was expected that along with D.S. de Silva, he would form a spin combination that would hold Sri Lanka in good stead during its formative years in test cricket. However, this was not the case, his returns in three other Tests were below expectations. On the tour to Pakistan he bowled accurately at Karachi and Faisalabad but struggled to dismiss Test-quality batsman.

Already an experienced first-class cricketer when Sri Lanka gained Test status, Dias formed the backbone of the batting along with Duleep Mendis in the period following the Sri Lanka's inception. In the proceeding Test tour to Pakistan, Dias highlighted his class. Scoring 295 runs at 49.16, including 98 at Faisalabad and then following up\nwith  109 at Lahore, holding firm as the top order crumbled around him in a the face of a withering barrage of pace bowling from Imran Khan. In Sri Lanka's maiden Test victory, and series victory, over India at home in 1985-86, Dias' contribution was decisive. Twin fifties in the second Test had helped set up\na win, then with Sri Lanka on the brink of oblivion in the final Test, Dias rescued Sri Lanka with a superlative 106, ensuring a draw was achieved.

A dominant figure on cricket fields all over the world for nearly 20 years, he never shied from confrontation, defending his players and rights to the hilt.Despite his relative inability to scamper the quick single which is considered essential in one-day cricket, Ranatunga had an uncanny ability to keep the scoreboard ticking over using deft placement on both sides of the wicket, combined with fluent driving through the offside in particular. He was a deceptive and useful medium-pace bowler, although his bowling was seen rarely in the later part of his career. He lost the captaincy following Sri Lanka's poor showing in the 1999 World Cup, and retired from international cricket a year later, but his contribution to Sri Lankan cricket is immense.

Wettimuny also became the first Sri Lankan to carry his bat through an innings when he completed the feat against New Zealand at Christchurch in 1982-83 - he scored an unbeaten 63 out of a meager total of 144.Wettimuny suffered from not having a stable partner up the opposite end as Sri Lanka struggled to find an established opening partnership.

        "description": "Joseph Ravindran \"Ravi\" Ratnayeke (born 2 May 1960), is a Sri Lankan Australian businessman and former cricketer[1] who was ODI captain of Sri Lankan cricket team. Ratnayeke played 22 Tests and 78 ODIs from 1982 to 1990, his Test best bowling performance of eight wickets for 83 runs at Jinnah Stadium (Sialkot) Pakistan was a Sri Lankan Test record at the time, and was also vice captain to Arjuna Ranatunga.[2]",
        "career": "Ravi Ratnayeke was a player capable of genuine allround performances with both bat and ball in hand. A right-arm medium-pace bowler with the ability to bowl at a lively pace and move the ball in favorable conditions. To compliment his ability with the ball he was also a competent left-hand batsman in the lower order. As his career developed so did his batting, such was his ability he was asked to open the batting at test level and did so with success. Perhaps his greatest attribute was his tenacity and resolve, always willing to compete in a side that was usually less than competitive. Scripted into the side as a 21 year old, Ratnayeke was originally selected as a specialist bowler. On the unresponsive wickets in Pakistan he toiled in relative obscurity earning four expensive wickets and batting as low as No. 10. Wickets and runs were difficult to come by at first, but the selectors persevered and against New Zealand at the SSC he had a breakthrough when he took 5 for 42. The back-to-back series against Pakistan enabled Ratnayeke cement his position in the side with impressive displays with the ball and his ever improving batting provided valuable runs in the lower order. At Sialkot he produced a devastating display wrecking the Pakistan innings with figures of 8 for 83, the figures remaining the benchmark for all Sri Lankan bowlers until recent times. Pushed into the opening position on the tour of India in 1985-86, Ratnayeke responded to the added responsibility. In his debut innings combating the new ball he scored a remarkable 93 adding 159 with Siddath Wettimuny, later capturing 4 wickets in a superb allround display. In the second Test, as Sri Lanka capitulated he\nheld firm top scoring with 54, upstaging his more distinguished colleagues. He completed an outstanding series capturing 5 for 85 in the final test at Cuttack.\nThis determination and competitive nature was highlighted in his series against Australia. In 1988 he toiled manfully as Australia crushed the Sri Lankans, capturing 4 for 98 in 40 tidy overs. With the bat he scored 28 and 34 as the rest of the batting yielded. In the next series in Australia, the penultimate in his career, he batted with purpose and resolve scoring two fifties both when Sri Lanka were at their greatest need.\nJohann P Jayasekera",

Despite taking the new ball he was used sparingly although he did take 1 for 23 in the first innings.

He was expected to continue to be a key player in the fledgling Sri Lankan team but all that ended when he chose to join the infamous Sri Lankan rebel tour to South Africa in 1982-83, earning him a life ban.

Amal Silva was preferred in the next match, though De Alwis kept in all three Tests when New Zealand toured Sri Lanka. De Alwis's keeping was exemplary and while he made some handy scores in the lower order he could not convert them. Injury on the 1984 tour of England cost him his place, and Silva had a tremendous Test at Lords and kept his place with some solid knocks thereafter. In his further Tests - when Silva was injured or unwell - de Alwis kept tidily but his batting was below standard.

Injury to de Alwis on the\n1984 tour of England gave Silva his second cap and he took his\nopportunity with aplomb. Silva opened the batting making an\nassured unbeaten 102 in the second innings to compliment his\nthree catches behind the wicket.

In the second he had a\nsensational all-round match, scoring  111, taking 8 catches and\nmaking 1 stumping, Silva was a major player in Sri Lanka's\ninaugural test match victory. In all Silva captured 22\ndismissals, 21 catches and 1 stumping, still a record for a Sri\nLankan keeper in a series to this day.  Following this\nunprecedented performance Silva's career went into a decline as\nhe struggled to deal with the responsibility of combating the new\nball and then keeping wickets to an international standard. After\nthe series in 1985/86 against Pakistan the selectors preferred\nother options.

Guneratne was a leg-spinner for the Nomads club, who played one Test for Sri Lanka; he had just left Colombo's Nalanda College and was playing only his second first-class match. After dismissing Kepler Wessels and Greg Chappell on his first-class debut, for the Board President's XI in April 1983, he was picked for the only Test of the tour, but failed to take a wicket or score a run in an innings defeat. After just 17 wickets in a 13-match first-class career, he left to join his family in the US. He was only the third Sri Lankan Test cricketer to die, after Sridharan Jeganathan and Anura Ranasinghe, and the current team wore black armbands in his memory on the first day of the Kandy Test against West Indies.",

Capable with the bat, on his day he could produce an attacking array of strokes that often set the opposition team aback with its ferocity. Labrooy made an inauspicious debut against India, batting at No. 11 and taking one expensive wicket as  batsmen dominated the Test. At Lord's against England he added 64 for the last wicket with Ravi Ratnayeke, scoring 42 stylish runs while claiming 4 wickets with the ball. His development was held back by Sri Lanka's sporadic Test schedule. Due to the political tension in his homeland all of his nine Tests spread over a lengthy period, were played overseas. On the Australian tour he\ncaptured his first five wicket haul taking 5 for 133 at the Gabba. On the tour of New Zealand he just seemed to finding his feet at international level taking the new ball with Rumesh Ratnayake. With the ball he captured 13 wickets. In the third Test at Auckland, unfortunately his final Test, he had a superb allround match. With the ball he captured 3 for 48 and 4 for 42 and with the bat he launched an astonishing display battering the Kiwi attack, scoring an unbeaten 70 in 80 balls with  14 boundaries.\nJohann P Jayasekera",

        "career": "Ramanayake was a wholehearted performer, a willing worker with a steely determination -  he never shirked the issue. During a period when Sri Lanka lacked a true pace bowling threat Ramanayake, a genuine medium pacer, bore the brunt of the work-load. Ramanayake lacked the raw pace to be a genuine\nwicket-taking threat at Test level. An honest toiler he usually managed to check the batsman without dismissing them.On his Test debut against Australia in Perth he went wicketless. His first wicket came in his second Test against England when he dismissed Phil Newport. On the 1989-90 tour of Australia he was forced to work hard for his four wickets, though better times came on the tour of New Zealand when he provided solid support for Labrooy and Ratnayake taking 11 wickets in the three Test\nseries. The role of support bowler suited Ramanayake to a tee as he was capable of extended spells of accurate bowling. Ramanayake's moment of glory came in the subsequent home series against Australia  when he spearheaded the attack taking 17 wickets in 3 Tests, including a career-best 5 for 82 at Moratuwa. He\nformed a successful new ball partnership in this series with new boy Duleep Liyanage causing the Australian top order difficulties with movement and swing. It was a just reward for the perseverance and willingness to work under arduous conditions. It proved to be a brief glimpse of the heady heights of stardom as\nRamanayake returned to grafting out Test batsman for the remainder of his international career.At the one-day level Ramanayake's style was an effective weapon and he was an excellent performer with his steady line and length. His ability to control the run rate made him a permanent fixture in this form of the game.After playing his final Test in 1993 he maintained a position in the one-day outfit before drifting from the international scene. A fine domestic season prior to the tour of Australia in 1995-96 saw him thrust his name in front of selectors. They could have done worse than selecting Ramanayake, and they did deciding to go with a younger generation, none of which performed with any note.A qualified coach at Level I (English) and Level II (Australian), he headed Sri Lanka's Fast Bowling Academy for seven years, grooming several bowlers who went on to play for the country. He was appointed Bangladesh's fast bowling coach in March 2008. \nJohann P Jayasekera",

Wickremasinghe made his Test debut against Australia at the Gabba on the 1989-90 tour taking three catches behind the wicket and scoring two runs. Injury forced him to miss\nthe second test at Hobart and Tillekeratne took over the position giving an impressive display. From that point on Wickremasinghe was cast into the background as the selectors preferred Tillekeratne due to his pedigree as a batsman at domestic level. Wickremasinghe continued to be a steady, capable performer at domestic level and earned a recall against New Zealand in 1992-93. Sri Lanka won the series and Wickremasinghe gave an assured display behind the wickets dealing with the spin of Muralitharan, Warnaweera and Anurasiri with style. However, the selectors in their wisdom not for the first time chose to plump for the player with superior batting skills. For the next few years a number of candidates were tried without much success while Wickremasinghe continued to perform reliably at domestic level.

        "career": "A tough competitor and adhesive crease-occupier, Hashan Tillakaratne was an important figure in Sri Lanka's emergence as an international force. As a schoolboy he excelled at cricket, first at Isipathana College Colombo and then subsequently at DS Senanayake College. He first came to prominence with a match-saving century against England B at Galle in 1986 while still at school, and went on to make his one-day international debut against India in November of that year. A Test debut followed against Australia three years later and early on in his Test career Tillakaratne often played as batsman-wicketkeeper.But his considerable batting potential was realised when he gave up the gloves in 1994. Tillakaratne was an important figure in Sri Lanka's emergence as an international force which culminated with a historic victory in the Wills World cup in 1996. He lost his place when Sri Lanka turned to youth after the 1999 World Cup, but heavy scoring in domestic cricket brought him back into the national team in 2001. His return bolstered the middle order and he enjoyed a prolific run with the bat until being named Test captain in April 2003. His ten-match tenure produced just one win, which clinched a series against England later in the year, and his leadership style was criticised for being too defensive. Following a 3-0 series whitewash against Australia he stepped down in March 2004, and despite remaining keen to continue his career as a batsman, he was overlooked for the subsequent tour of Zimbabwe.On February 1 2005, the Sri Lankan board appointed him executive director of Cricket-Aid, a body formed to provide relief following the December 2004 tsunami. Subsequently he turned his considerable people skills to politics , joining the United National Party, the oldest political party in the country and was appointed as the party's organizer for Avissawella electorate in the Colombo district. He continues his association with cricket apart from working to uplift the lives of people in his electorate, serving in various committees on the SLC at the invitation of the newly appointed president, Arjuna Ranatunga. Tillakaratne was bestowed a rare honour when conferred with a honorary life membership of the MCC from March 2008 onwards. In May, he was appointed the president of the Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers of Sri Lanka (ACUSSL).  \n(Charlie Austin)",

        "career": "A vulnerable starter, Atapattu showed immense strength of character once he got his eye in. On a lifeless pitch, he was a master of the percentage game, his caution a useful counterpoint to the risks taken by Sanath Jayasuriya, his opening partner almost throughout his Test career. All his big Test innings - he scored six double-hundreds in his career, a feat bettered only by Don Bradman (12), Wally Hammond and Brian Lara (seven each) - were been slow affairs but the most tortuous episode of his international career was its start: it took him nearly seven years to get established. However, since the 1990s his average climbed upwards. An elegant player to watch, Atapattu's signature shot was his high-elbow cover-drive.For three years he stood as Jayasuriya's understudy before being appointed to lead the one-day side in April 2003. He had been expected to take charge of the Test team as well, but the selection committee appointed Hashan Tillakaratne for that job. Atapattu's career took another bizarre twist later in the year when embroiled in the cash-in-the-bedroom affair in which a match-fixing investigation was initiated after a large sum of cash was discovered in the safe of the hotel room he had occupied during England's tour in 2003. The ICC later cleared Atapattu of any wrongdoing and the likeliest explanation for the mystery remains a crude attempt to blacken his reputation.But by early 2004 the team was drifting downwards under Tillakaratne and the selectors were finally compelled to appoint Atapattu as the Test captain. Within weeks he had halted the team's slide and established himself as a strong leader. On the surface a quiet and reserved character, his captaincy pedigree was not entirely obvious to the outsider, but within the dressing-room he was a straight-talking and positive captain, firm and fair in his dealings with the players and aggressive in his approach to the game. By mid-2004 the fortunes of the team had changed as Sri Lanka won the Asia Cup and whitewashed South Africa. The team fared poorly in the ICC Champions Trophy but perked up against Pakistan in October 2004.But Atapattu's capacity for attracting the unexpected continued when, out of the blue, Ashantha de Mel, the new government-appointed chairman of selectors, launched a scathing attack on the team management on the eve of the Paktel Cup in 2004-05, accusing them of blocking his attempts to blood new players. Atapattu wisely steered clear of a public confrontation, though his relationship with the selectors remained prickly. His career was put on hold by a back injury early in 2006 which led to Mahela Jayawardene taking on the captaincy. He was slowly reintroduced to the one-day side, but his tussles with the selectors continued. He was a late inclusion on the Australian tour following a ministerial intervention to bring him into the squad, but midway through the series he hit out at the selectors again, calling them \"a set of muppets headed by a joker\". He scored two half-centuries in the series, including 80 in the second innings in Hobart, but announced his retirement from international cricket on the last day of the Test.   Atapattu then joined the unofficial Indian Cricket League, playing for the Delhi Giants and ICL World XI. A ban on he and four other Sri Lankans was lifted in September 2008, meaning Atapattu was free to play domestic cricket back home.Since retirement from all cricket, Atapattu has forged a reputation as a technically adroit and hard-working batting coach, particularly for his work with the Sri Lanka team. He has been the national side's batting coach since 2011, and was promoted to the position of assistant coach in March 2013. In the wake of Paul Farbrace's sudden departure from the head coach position a year later, Atapattu was appointed the interim head coach for the away tour of England, and the home tour against South Africa, in July.\nCricinfo staff September 2008\n",

Capable of playing lengthy innings when the situation warranted ,Hathurusingha possessed a variety of strokes. A handy medium-pace bowler, capable of genuine movement through the air. Called into the side against New Zealand at Hamilton as a replacement for the injured Mahanama, he responded by making three half-centuries in his first three Tests. Despite some handy contributions in following series, after an arduous time against the pace of South Africans he found himself left out. After a period on the sidelines, during which no other opener could establish a permanent position, he was selected to tour Pakistan and responded with an excellent series. After the emergence of Sanath Jayasuriya on the proceeding tour of Australia, Hathurusingha was again left out. Sri Lanka's failure to develop a competent allrounder saw Hathrurusingha reincarnated as a middle-order batsman and medium-pace bowler during the tour of England and The Asian Test Championship, though this experiment was shortlived. Chosen for the 1999 World Cup, Hathurusinghe was not called upon to play a single match, and the selectors' policy of picking younger players singled the end to his international career. He quit first-class cricket in 2005 to focus on coaching and has since coached UAE and Sri Lanka A. ",

Considered one of the greatest attacking batsmen of his era, Jayasuriya is well known for his powerful striking and match-winning all-round performances in ODI cricket.[3] Jayasuriya is credited for having revolutionized one-day international cricket with his explosive batting with Romesh Kaluwitharana in the mid 1990s, which initiated the hard-hitting modern-day batting strategy of all nations.[4][5] Jayasuriya was an all-rounder, who had an international cricket career that spread over four decades.[6] He is the only player to score over 10,000 runs and capture more than 300 wickets in One Day International cricket. Regarded as one of the best all-rounders in the history of limited-overs cricket, Jayasuriya created many records during his career.[7][8]",
        "career": "It's hard to imagine that for the first half-decade of his career, Sanath Jayasuriya was considered a bowler who could bat a bit. Think of him now and you think of forearms straight out of a smithy, shots hammered through point and cover and scythes over the leg side. You recall a man who could score equally briskly in every form of the game, who slashed and burned his way through bowling attacks. As with anyone who relied so much on extraordinary hand-eye coordination, there were troughs and lean times, but just as the obit writers got busy, he would produce another innings of supreme power. The bowling, always canny and relying more on variations in pace than sharp turn, became the supporting act, though 440 international wickets should tell you that he was pretty adept at what he did.Following Mark Greatbatch's success at the 1992 World Cup, most teams were rethinking the way they approached the one-day game and Jayasuriya, who had trawled the lower reaches of the middle order till then, had his first stint as opener during the Hero Cup in India in 1993. It was only during a home series against Pakistan the following year that he established himself in the role and by the time the World Cup rolled around 18 months later, he had already chalked up his first century in whites, a frenetic stroke-filled effort in Adelaide. The years that followed were both prolific and successful. People remember Aravinda de Silva's magical innings from the semi-final and final of  the 1996 World Cup but it was Jayasuriya's withering assaults that deflated India in Delhi and England in the last eight. Soon after, he began to exact as heavy a toll on Test attacks, scoring at such a pace that Muttiah Muralitharan and friends had ample time to work their way through opposition batsmen.After Arjuna Ranatunga's ouster, there was a four-year stint as captain that ended with a semi-final appearance at the 2003 World Cup, and just as the whispers grew about diminishing returns with the bat, he had one of his most successful years in 2004. There was a retirement announcement  in 2006, but he was back within weeks, and the walk off the Test stage came only 18 months later, after a typically cavalier innings in Kandy.The one-day flame continued to burn bright, and took Sri Lanka to another World Cup final in 2007, and he was instrumental in the Asia Cup win of 2008, a couple of months after it had seemed that the selectors' axe had fallen for the final time. The Indian Premier League gave him a new platform to showcase his big-hitting talent, but failure to replicate the success of the first season in subsequent campaigns was the surest sign that time had finally caught up with a man who was still pounding out one-day hundreds at the age of 39. His election as a Member of Parliament in April 2010 and his subsequent failure at the World Twenty20 suggested that his international career may be at an end, but he made the longlist for the 30-man squad for the 2011 World Cup, before being recalled to the one-day side for the series in England two weeks shy of his 42nd birthday.Dileep Premachandran",

Averaging over 6 wickets per test match, Murali is regarded as the greatest and most successful bowler to ever play international cricket. He is the only bowler to take 800 test wickets and 530+ ODI wickets. As of October\u00a02021[update], he has taken more wickets in international cricket than any other bowler.[4]",
        "career": "Perhaps no cricketer since Douglas Jardine has polarised opinion quite like Muthiah Muralidaran. For the believers, he's among the greatest to ever spin a ball. For the doubters, he's a charlatan undeserving of the game's greatest records, responsible for changes in the laws that they think have legitimised throwing. What was undeniable was his ability to turn the ball sharply on just about any surface, and bowl the sort of marathon spells that would have seen a lesser man retire after five seasons rather than 18. Whether Sri Lanka played at home, on pitches where he was often unplayable, or overseas, Murali was the go-to man for half a dozen captains. He seldom disappointed.Scion of a family with confectionery interests in Kandy, he first came to prominence during a tour game against Australia in 1992-93, when no less a batsman than Allan Border failed to pick him. From the outset, his action was an object of wonder or ridicule, depending on which side of the fence you stood. A deformed elbow was only part of the story. Murali had exceptionally supple wrists and a shoulder that rotated as rapidly as a fast bowler's at the time of delivery. A combination of all these factors combined to enable him to turn the ball far more than most orthodox finger-spinners, but it was only with his mastering the doosra, the one that went the other way or held its line, that he became Shane Warne's rival in the wicket-taking and greatness stakes.The controversies always kept him company, yet Murali seldom lost his wide-eyed smile, or the ability to run through batting sides. Darrell Hair called him for throwing on Boxing Day in 1995, and Ross Emerson followed suit three years later. In 2004, he was asked to refrain from bowling his doosra, after it was found to exceed the 15-degree tolerance limit that had been agreed on after extensive analysis of his and other actions. While the sceptics continued to denigrate his achievements, Murali even bowled on television in a special cast, going through his entire repertoire to try and convince the doubters.Part of the World Cup-winning side in 1996, he was instrumental in the run to the final 11 years later, and he played his part in some of the country's greatest sporting moments. It was his 16 wickets that helped rout England at The Oval in 1998, back in the days when Sri Lanka were deemed worthy of only one Test. He averaged less than 30 with the ball in every country except India and Australia, and he finished a remarkable Test career with more than 100 wickets against India, England and South Africa.Backed to the hilt by Arjuna Ranatunga, he blossomed in the late 1990s, and there was a period when the opposition routinely budgeted for 20 Murali wickets or more in a three-Test series. As the years passed, his shyness gave way to a quiet confidence and wry sense of humour, and he won admirers around the world for the energy, time and money that he invested in reconstruction after a tsunami had devastated the Sri Lankan coast in 2004. Often the only Tamil in the side in a time of ethnic conflict, he became as powerful a unifying force as any in the country. That he was such a hero with ball in hand was only part of the story.",

However, international cricket proved a difficult hurdle and Ranatunga was dropped from the side.

Vaas currently holds the record for the best bowling figures in ODI history, and is the only bowler to take an 8-wicket haul in ODIs.",
        "career": "Chaminda Vaas is easily the most penetrative and successful new-ball bowler Sri Lanka have had, and he has served his country well. He swings and seams the ball with skill, his trademark delivery being the late indipper. However, he also bowls a carefully disguised offcutter, and has recently added reverse-swing to his armoury, a skill that has made him a consistent wicket-taker even on bland subcontinental pitches. He outbowled New Zealand's seamers in green conditions at Napier to give Sri Lanka their first win in an overseas Test, in 1994-95. In 2001-02 he made a quantum leap, taking 26 wickets in the 3-0 rout of West Indies, becoming only the second fast bowler, after Imran Khan, to take 14 wickets in a match in the subcontinent. He then went on to take the first-ever ODI eight-for, against Zimbabwe, which included a hat-trick. He also claimed a hat-trick with the first three balls of the match against Bangladesh in the 2003 World Cup. Vaas reached the 300-wicket milestone in Tests against India in 2005-06, having passed the mark in ODIs on the tour to Zimbabwe. In 2004 he also gained overdue recognition for his talent when he was selected for the World XI at the inaugural ICC Awards. Vaas is easily Sri Lanka's second-most successful bowler - after Muttiah Muralitharan - in both forms of the game. His approach to his batting is equally sincere and in recent years he has gradually gained recognition as a useful allrounder. He waited 97 Tests for his maiden century, against Bangladesh, and soon after, became the third Sri Lankan to play 100 Tests or more.In August 2008, Vaas crossed yet another milestone when he had Yuvraj Singh caught for a duck in Colombo to get his 400th ODI wicket and become the fourth bowler to reach the landmark.  In July 2009, Vaas announced his retirement from Tests but said he will continue to play one-dayers and Twenty20s till the 2011 World Cup. \n",

        "career": "A left-arm seam bowler with a loping, rhythmical run-up and action, Zoysa has shown plenty of promise, but his career has so far been plagued by injuries. He was discarded after a disappointing tour to England in 2002, but he trained hard and regained pace, nip and bounce off the pitch. Most importantly, though, he returned with the delivery that moves back into the right-hander, a weapon that makes him a far more potent force.A natural striker of the ball, he's also emerged as a useful lower-order strokeplayer. During the A tour to Kenya in 2003, he was even employed as a pinch-hitter to good effect, and, making his comeback to international cricket in the one-day series against Australia in 2003-04, Zoysa further underscored his batting potential with a matchwinning unbeaten 47 in the final match.His bowling continued on its upward curve, culminating in a damaging five-wicket haul against South Africa in the one-day series in 2004-05. First spotted by Arjuna Ranatunga, who encouraged him to join the SSC in Colombo, he made his debut during the 1996-97 tour of New Zealand.

He was the first Twenty20 International cap for Sri Lanka as he was part of Sri Lanka's first ever T20I team. He retired from cricket in 2007 after playing the final in 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup.[5][6]",
        "career": "Arnold's ability to adapt his game to the situation makes him an ideal No.6 in limited overs cricket and an unselfish approach explains the high esteem in which he is held by teammates. A cool head under pressure helps when chasing and he adds great value in field with a safe pair of hands. He can also bowl useful offbreaks.A tall, angular left-hander and a patient accumulator, Arnold began his Test career as an opener but despite solid scores then, and on his recall for the Asian Test Championship two years later, he lost out to Marvan Atapattu as Sanath Jayasuriya's partner. Short of runs by late 2000, he dropped into the lower middle order. When a loss of form and confidence from Jayasuriya gave Arnold another chance at the top of the order in 2002, he scored 62 and 109 in a valiant rearguard at Old Trafford. Failure in the series that followed left him on the sidelines for long periods after the 2003 World Cup but Arnold made his way back into the team for the home series against Australia. Despite making 51 not out in his last ODI against Zimbabwe, Arnold was dropped from the ODI and Test teams in July 2004. The seven-man Ashantha de Mel selection committee wanted to blood new talent and Arnold's future looked bleak for a while. But he worked hard on his game in the nets and started to score heavily in domestic cricket. Finally, with his replacements failing to impress, he won a recall for the New Zealand tour in December 2004.  However, pressure from the young brigade - the likes of Tillakaratne Dilshan - left him fighting for his place. His Test role went first but, after a poor tour of England in 2006 (following some promising efforts in Australia), he was dumped. But experience can never be discounted in major tournaments and he found a spot in the 2007 World Cup squad. Arnold retired after the World Cup final and joined the unofficial Indian Cricket League, playing for the Chennai Superstars and ICL World XI. A ban on he and four other Sri Lankans was lifted in September 2008, meaning Arnold was free to play domestic cricket back home. He has also dabbled in radio commentary. \nCharlie Austin September 2008",

Mahela is the most successful captain for Sri Lanka along with Sanath Jayasuriya. He made his Test cricket debut in August 1997 and his One Day International (ODI) debut the following season in January 1998. In 2006 along with his team mate Kumar Sangakkara, Jayawardene made the highest ever partnership in First Class cricket, scoring 624 runs for the third wicket in the first test match of Sri Lanka's home series against South Africa.[1] He appeared in 652 international matches representing Sri Lanka in a career spanning for about 18 years. During his international career, he also formed a healthy relationship and friendship with fellow veteran player Kumar Sangakkara.[2][3]",
        "career": "A prolific, elegant and utterly classy batsman with a huge appetite for runs, and a calm yet authoritative captain - those are the qualities that best describe Mahela Jayawardene. His sheer quality as a batsman was never in doubt even when he just entered the international scene, but for Jayawardene the biggest challenge has been to justify all the early hype. With over 10,000 runs in both Tests and ODIs - and a captaincy stint that included a World Cup final appearance - it can safely be said that he has met that challenge more than adequately.Blessed with excellent hand-eye coordination and a fine technique, Jayawardene scores his runs all around the wicket. Among his favourite strokes are the languid cover-drive - often with minimal footwork but precise placement and timing - and the wristy flick off his legs, but there are several others he plays with equal felicity. The most memorable are the cuts and dabs he plays behind the stumps, mostly off spinners, but also against quick bowling, when bat makes contact with ball delightfully late. Apart from his artistry, what stands out about his batting is his hunger for big scores, most apparent in his record 624-run partnership with Kumar Sangakkara, but also in the regularity with which he notches up Test double-hundreds. And his century against Zimbabwe in the World Twenty20 in 2010 was a shining example of traditional methods succeeding in a new format.Jayawardene is easily one of the most elegant batsmen of his generation, but the major drawback in his career is his relative lack of success in overseas conditions. His averages in Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand are all less than 35, but at home he averages more than 60.In the second half of his career, Jayawardene grew into an astute captain who read the game well and wasn't afraid to take risks. Under him, Sri Lanka shed their diffident approach, winning Tests in England and New Zealand, and - in what was Jayawardene's greatest achievement as captain - reached the final of the 2007 World Cup. He quit captaincy in February 2009, but agreed to a second stint, taking over from Tillakaratne Dilshan after the tour to South Africa in 2011-12, but resigned again after a year, handing the reins to Angelo Mathews. His limited overs batting has improved with age, and an increasing stroke repertoire has seen Jayawardene become almost as impressive an innovator at the crease, as he is a technician. An unbeaten 103 from 88 balls in the 2011 World Cup final made plain his limited  overs prowess, and marked him out as a big-match player, having already made a century in the semi-final of the same tournament four years ago. \nS Rajesh and ESPNcricinfo staff",

But a match haul of 11 for 126 against England A in March 2005 confirmed his growing confidence and also helped attract the attention of Gloucestershire as they looked for a replacement for Upul Chandana. Bandara, like Chandana, is also a useful lower order batsman. He hasn't been able to nail a permanent place in the one-day set-up but has provided valuable support for Muttiah Muralitharan. It is his all-round versatility which won him a World Cup place for the Caribbean ahead of Chandana. He played just one game and has since struggled to find a place in the line-up.

His batting gained a new authority and his bowling greater potency, as he topped both the batting and bowling averages in that unofficial Test series. A wonderfully supple fielder, capable of match-turning run-outs and sizzling airbourne catches, he was in and out of both the Test and one-day squads for a number of years before bedding down in the one-day team in mid-2003 after a match-winning innings at Bridgetown. His explosive qualities in the middle order made him an asset in the limited-overs game. But his bowling has also continued to improve, making him a better bet for Tests as well. Murali's withdrawal from the tour to Australia in 2004 put additional responsibility on him, and he responded well. As the year progressed, his legbreaks, traditionally nagging rather than explosive, started to fizz more venomously. More importantly, his line and length tightened up. By the end of the Asia Cup in 2004 he had become an important wicket-taker in the one-day team, but his form fell away and he was dropped late in 2005, making one rather unexpected one-day appearance in July 2007, retiring soon after.

He is currently working as spin bowling consultant with the Bangladesh cricket team.[2]",
        "career": "Rangana Herath is an orthodox left-arm spinner who has taken over from Muttiah Muralitharan as Sri Lanka's main wicket-taking bowler in Tests. As a left-arm spinner, his strengths are his accuracy and his ability to bowl long spells, but to that he has added a 'mystery' ball, a delivery that is quicker and darts back into the right-hander. In his early years, he was seen as a support act to Muralitharan, though he had his moments to savour: against Pakistan in 2009, his 4 for 15 got Sri Lanka an improbable win, as Pakistan were bundled out for 117 chasing 168. Most of the time during that period, though, his role was to bowl long spells block the runs and build pressure on the batsmen, allowing Murali to work his magic from the other end.Since Murali's retirement, Herath has been Sri Lanka's go-to bowler. His unrelenting accuracy, and his ability to subtly vary his pace and flight have made him a potent force even overseas, where conditions don't always favour spin bowling. On Sri Lanka's tour to South Africa in 2011-12, Herath's match haul of 9 for 128 helped the team to their first Test win in South Africa. Next season he also had an impressive tour of Australia, bowling long spells, taking wickets and keeping the runs in check when the fast bowlers struggled to exercise any sort of control. He was the leading wicket-taker in Tests in 2012, with 60 at an average of 23.61, thus proving conclusively that he had broken out of Murali's shadow, and was among the best left-arm spinners going around.ESPNcricinfo staff\n",

He loves to make room and thrash the ball through the off side, but the stroke that bears his signature more than any other is the one he developed for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 - the eponymously named \"Dilscoop\" shot over his head, which confounded bowlers and experts alike.In fact, 2009 was a watershed year in his career, and a huge factor was his move up the batting order to open the innings in all three forms of the game. It was a move that proved his making, as he exploited attacking fields and amassed huge scores in all formats: he scored 11 international hundreds in the year, and won the World Twenty20 Player of the Series prize.Dilshan's abundant talent was never in doubt from the moment he made his debut, but he went through several early troughs, most notably when he was dropped from 2001 to 2003. Having burst onto the international scene with an unbeaten 163 against Zimbabwe in his first series in November 1999, Dilshan's career remained largely unfulfilled until he cemented his place as one of the most destructive openers in the modern era. Add his electric fielding, especially at backward point, and his underrated offspin, and Dilshan is a quality package. In 2011 he was named Sri Lanka's captain, after the resignation of Kumar Sangakkara, but his reign lasted less than a year, with Mahela Jayawardene replacing him after Sri Lanka's tour to South Africa in 2011-12. Like his team, Dilshan had had a poor run of form while he was captain, but his batting enjoyed a revival after being relieved of leadership, particularly in ODI cricket, where he was 2012's second-heaviest scorer, with 1119 runs. \nJamie Alter ",

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen and wicket-keeper in the history of the sport. He was officially rated in the top three current batsmen in the world in all three formats of the game at various stages of his international career.[1][2][3][4][5] Sangakkara scored 28,016 runs in international cricket across all formats in a career that spanned 15 years.[6] At retirement, he was the second-highest run-scorer in ODI cricket, next only to Sachin Tendulkar, and the sixth-highest run scorer in Test cricket.[7][8]",
        "career": "As soon as he broke into the side at the age of 22, while a law student, it was apparent that Kumar Sangakkara was destined for more than just batting stardom. The left-handers that had preceded him, like Arjuna Ranatunga and Asanka Gurusinha, had been pugnacious battlers but Sangakkara was cut from more graceful cloth, easing into strokes with the elegance often associated withthose that play with the 'other' hand. The cut and the pull came naturally to him and with growing confidence, he became a more assured front-foot player as well.Ranatunga had already exploded the myth of the Sri Lankans being meek men who could be bullied, but Sangakkara has refined the belligerence, combining a suave exterior with cutting asides and sharp sledges from behind the stumps. Initially, his glovework wasn't for the purists, but such was his batting ability that there was no question of displacing him from the XI.As a batsman, he has matured steadily, and the appetite for runs was best illustrated at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo in 2006, when he and Mahela Jayawardene, captain and close friend, added 624 against a South African attack boasting Dale Steyn and Makhaya Ntini. Sangakkara contributed 287 and did his burgeoning reputation no harm a year later when he went to Hobart and scored a dazzling 192 in a close defeat. By then, he already had a half-century in a World Cup final to his name, and long before Jayawardene relinquished the captaincy, it was understood that Sangakkara would be the anointed one.He has been far less relentless in the one-day arena, often throwing his wicket away when well set, but his leadership qualities have made him a sought-after signing in the Indian Premier League. With the captain's burden on his shoulders, he no longer keeps in Test matches, but the smart-alec remarks from behind the stumps are a common feature of every game that Sri Lanka plays in coloured clothes.Although leadership drew the best from him as a batsman, he remains a voracious no. 3 in all forms despite having relinquished the reins in 2011. Sangakkara won the top prize at 2012's ICC awards, in addition to the award for Test Cricketer of the Year and the People's Choice award for the second year running. Later that year he confirmed himself among batting's modern greats, by becoming the equal fastest man to 10,000 Test runs alongside Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara, with the biggest Test crowd Sri Lanka had ever played for in audience, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. .Dileep Premachandran and ESPNcricinfo staff",

        "career": "Thilan Samaraweera's batting will not fill a stadium; yet, in a batting line-up of flamboyant strokeplayers, his patience and solidity offers a vital balancing factor. In his second avatar he has added more strokes to make his batting more well-rounded, but what Samaraweera does best is wear bowlers down through patient and relentless accumulation. His batting is built around reserves of resilience, determination and sheer toughness, and he had to draw into them all to overcome the trauma of cricket's darkest hours - the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore.Samaraweera will forever be remembered for not letting a bullet injury end his international career. He was in his best form, having scored two consecutive double-centuries in Pakistan, when his team bus came under fire in March 2009 and a bullet penetrated 12 inches into his left thigh. He needed surgery and spent three months dealing with the physical and mental wounds of his ordeal. That Samaraweera returned to play his 50th Test in July was a triumph of his strength of character.His return was a second coming after he had begun his career with a hundred on debut against India in 2001. The retirements of Aravinda de Silva and Hashan Tillakaratne gave Samaraweera a run in the middle order but indifferent form in 2006 led to him being dropped. He returned 18 months later, a more aggressive, prolific batsman and yet remained as solid as he was before, reigniting his career with a century against India in July 2008. It was the beginning of a purple patch which continued even after his run-in with gunmen.Despite all the runs Samaraweera scored, question-marks remained due to his relative lack of success outside the subcontinent. Worse was to follow when he went through a wretched run of form against Australia at home, in 2011. He was subsequently dropped for the Tests against Pakistan in UAE, but defeat in that series forced the selectors to recall him for the South Africa tour. Samaraweera responded in style with two centuries when some of his more illustrious team-mates struggled to put bat to ball. Samaraweera's finest hour came when his century in Durban delivered Sri Lanka their first win in South Africa. Though he had a moderately successful year in 2012, Samaraweera was the most notable batting failure in Sri Lanka's year-end tour of Australia. Despite scoring plenty of runs in the domestic season thereafter, he didn't find a place in Sri Lanka's squad for the home Test series against Bangladesh. With no meaningful Test cricket scheduled for Sri Lanka for several months, Samaraweera announced his retirement from all international cricket in March 2013.George Binoy ",

He was then picked for a Board XI side against India in August 2001 and booked himself a berth in Sri Lanka's 16-man Test squad on the back of an impressive century. He sat on the sidelines throughout the series, but was finally given a chance against Bangladesh in 2001 when the selectors rested senior players. However, despite scoring a century in the second Test, he then waited three-and-half-years before reclaiming a place in the national squad. Opportunities were restricted due to the established Jayasuriya-Atapattu opening combination, but many argue he has nonetheless been unfairly ignored by the selectors.  An injury to Sanath Jayasuriya paved the way for his ODI debut against Australia at Melbourne in February 2006. He top scored with a gritty but slow 48 but was then dropped for the rest of his series. He played two Tests in the Bangladesh series that followed, again showing an impressive adhesiveness and is particularly strong off the front foot, through the off-side and leg-side.

Faced with a weak opposition, Maharoof picked up a bunch of wickets, but then came up against better competitors during the Asia Cup. He performed reasonably well, and made a mark with his swinging deliveries when South Africa came visiting.

A useful series with bat and ball against Pakistan in early 2006 suggested he was ready to push on, but his bowling failed to impress on the tour of England - taking only one wicket in three Tests - in conditions that should have suited him.Then came an astonishing display at the Champions Trophy in India when his 6 for 14 skittled West Indies out for 80.

Malinga is a right-arm fast bowler that is commonly used as a specialist death bowler, and is well known for his distinctive round-arm action, sometimes referred to as a sling action, which leads to his nickname \"Slinga Malinga\".[4] Malinga had announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on 14 September 2021.",
        "career": "One of the great limited-overs bowlers in his pomp, Lasith Malinga gained a reputation for delivering searing inswinging yorkers from a round-arm action as destructive as it was distinctive. That yorker, a deceptive slower ball, and an excellent bouncer formed the body of Malinga's menace, while the action made his deliveries hard to pick up. All that ability was also set off by street smarts; Malinga was rarely shy to switch up plans, and reshuffle fields. Even when batsmen thought they knew what was about to come, Malinga retained the capacity to surprise.Found in his teens playing soft-ball cricket on the beaches of Rathgama, just north of Galle, Malinga became one of the poster boys for the informal Sri Lankan coaching system and its philosophy of equipping unconventional bowlers, rather than remaking them. Malinga has repeatedly credited Champaka Ramanayake for his success. It was Ramanayake who initially took interest in him, and with whom he developed the yorker that became the foundation of his career. The coach would glue a pair of shoes near the popping crease. Malinga would spend hours bowling at them. Initially picked for his pace, Malinga toured Australia with the Sri Lanka team in 2004, where he claimed 6 for 90 in a tour match and went on to make his Test debut - he dismissed Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist in the same over, in Darwin. During an impressive tour of New Zealand the following year, his low-slung action resulted in the New Zealand batsmen asking the umpire to change the colour of their trousers as the ball was getting lost.But it was in the shorter formats that destiny beckoned Malinga. He became the first - and, so far, only - bowler to claim four wickets in four balls, when he took Sri Lanka to the brink of victory against South Africa, in the 2007 World Cup. He has two more ODI hat-tricks - against Australia and Kenya - and he quickly established himself as Sri Lanka's limited-overs spearhead. Though Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan also played important roles, Malinga was arguably the single-most important player in Sri Lanka's excellent run in global tournaments from 2007-2014.It is felt Malinga never realised his full potential in Tests, though perhaps through no fault of his own. He was only the third player to reach 100 Test wickets for Sri Lanka but a knee injury in 2008 laid him low for two years. He was picked again for Muttiah Muralitharan's farewell series, but again found himself injured for a period of some months. In April 2011, at the age of 27, Malinga announced his Test retirement, citing the desire to manage his \"chronic knee injury\" and extend his limited-overs career. It is thought his unique bowling action places a substantial load on the joints in his hips and legs. However, the fact that he announced his retirement while playing for Mumbai Indians in the IPL rankled at home. Through the forthcoming years, Malinga would go on to have a complicated relationship with Sri Lankan fans and media. In that time, he also became one of the IPL's iconic figures, representing Mumbai throughout.Malinga's finest moment came during the 2014 World T20, in which he nominally captained the side through the knockouts but, more importantly, delivered a clinical final spell to muzzle the India middle order. Sri Lanka would go on to win that title but, before long, Malinga's career became threatened by fitness issues - both involuntary and self-inflicted. In late 2014, a long-standing ankle complaint deteriorated to the extent that it required surgery. Malinga was a diminished force through the 2015 World Cup and became significantly slower in his later years, in which he also put on weight. He stepped down as T20 captain ahead of Sri Lanka's 2016 World T20 campaign, again owing to a chronic knee injury, this time in his left leg. He has at times suggested that his career hangs in the balance as a result of these injuries. At others he has said he wishes to play on for another few years. Andrew Fidel Fernando",

        "career": "Kulasekara made an instant impression in his first ODI, against England at Dambulla in November 2003, after being selected from relative obscurity. From a bustling run-up and whippy open-chested action, he generates a lively pace, moves the ball off the seam and can reverse-swing the ball. Most importantly though, he can maintain a tight line and length. He started his career as a softball enthusiast before he shifted his focus to cricket, joining Nugegoda Cricket Club and then Galle Cricket Club. He also won the best bowler award in the 2002-03 domestic competition. A maiden test fifty against England at Lord's in 2006 showed his natural batting abilities in the lower order. But his bowling during the same tour lacked penetration and he dropped out of the squad for eight months. However, having worked hard on his action and gaining an extra yard of pace, he secured a place in Sri Lanka's World Cup squad. He rose to become one of Sri Lanka's strike bowlers, and in a 11-month period starting April 2008, he took 47 wickets. That helped him jump to the top of the ICC ODI rankings the following March. \nCharlie Austin March 2009",

While younger batsmen have been given repeated opportunities to flatter and fail, Kalavitigoda has been\nconsistently accumulating first-class runs, scoring eight hundreds in the two seasons. In 2003-04 he was adjudged the best batsman in the Premier League, and in 2004-05 he scored nearly 800 runs for Colombo Colts and North West Province. That was enough to win him selection to the A team against England A in March 2005. He grabbed his opportunity with a fighting 83 off 177 balls at NCC in the second Test, an innings that persuaded the selectors to give him a chance in the senior team. When that opportunity did arrive in the second Test in Wellington he was shunted down to an unfamiliar No. 7 position and failed in both innings. Kalavitigoda's first taste of international cricket was with the Sri Lankan under-17 team at the 1994 World Cup in Malaysia.

        "career": "A batsman who has frustrated and thrilled in equal measure. Although his Test career has never really taken off - his two Test centuries have come more than 10 years apart - in ODIs he keeps illustrious company among Sri Lanka's finest. As of 2017, only Mahela Jayawardene, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya had scored more than Tharanga's 13 one-day centuriesTharanga's call-up to the Sri Lanka one-day squad in July 2005 brightened a year marred by the Asian tsunami, which washed away his family home in Ambalangoda, a fishing town on the west coast. From an early age he was tipped for the big time, playing Premier League cricket for Singha CC at the age of 15 and passing seamlessly and successfully through the Sri Lanka Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 development squads. He first really caught the eye during the Under-19 World Cup in 2004 when he cracked 117 against South Africa and then 61 in 42 balls against India in the next game. Then, after a successful tour with the under-19 team to Pakistan, during which he scored half-centuries in each of the two Tests and two one-day matches, the Sri Lankan board sent him to play league cricket in Essex, where he starred for Loughton Cricket Club. He soon graduated to the A team and after accomplished performances against West Indies A he was selected for the national squad a week later. However, it was on the 2006 tour of England that he really began to develop, especially in the one-day game, with an outstanding century at Lord's in the first match of Sri Lanka's 5-0 whitewash, and another in the final match as he and Jayasuriya flayed an opening stand of 286 in 32 overs.Back-to-back centuries followed in the Champions Trophy and he was forming a destructive partnership with Jayasuriya. After the Champions Trophy, however, it would be another three years until his next century. He flourished at the 2011 World Cup with score of 133 against Zimbabwe and an unbeaten 102 in the quarter-final against England.In 2013, during a tri-series in the Caribbean, he struck an unbeaten 174 against India in Jamaica but that would be his last fifty-plus score for 18 innings spread over three years during which time he spent considerable periods outside the team. He briefly returned when called up as an injury replacement at the 2015 World Cup, but his 2016 comeback provided slightly more longevity and he was named captain for the tri-series in Zimbabwe, a position he retained when Angelo Mathews was ruled out of the 2017 series in South Africa.\nJanuary 2017",

        "career": "Among the more frustrating players to have represented Sri Lanka in recent years, Chamara Kapugedara had ample opportunities at the top level between 2006 and 2012, but did not manage to nail down a place. That he is a rare talent has never been in doubt, but in international cricket, that raw ability has not usually translated into runs. Perhaps his fans will argue that he was asked to bat too low in limited-overs cricket to have a major impact on the game. Nevertheless, his returns were modest, and his place in the side became untenable, for a few years at least. Kapugedara has, however, enjoyed something of a renaissance in T20 cricket, after he was picked in the national side again in 2015. He impressed initially during his second coming, but another round of mixed results saw him in and out of the team. Despite having played top-level cricket for over a decade, he is still relatively young, and it is hoped he may yet come good as a consistent player. Naturally aggressive, and capable of clearing the boundary, Kapugedara had been one of the few genuinely exciting batsmen the selectors unearthed from Sri Lanka's Under-19 set-up. From the age of 11, when he first turned out for Dharmaraja College in Kandy, Kapugedera had hardly wasted an opportunity to push himself up the ladder. He had captained all the junior school sides from the U-13 to the first XI. Following a prolific 2003-04 season, where he scored over 1000 runs, he was picked for the U-19 tour to Pakistan the following year and had excelled with a stunning knock of 131 in a one-dayer against the world champions. It was an innings he had rated as one of his best although he batted equally well for 70 in his first game for Sri Lanka A against the strong New Zealand A team in 2005. The selectors, desperate to unearth new talent, eventually gambled on an early promotion and fast-tracked him into the national squad after several glowing reports from development coaches.Kapugedera's father, also a former Dharmaraja cricketer, provided early coaching and all the encouragement he needed to develop. David Karunaratne (his first coach) and Sumithra Warnakulasuriya (his U-19 coach) also played important roles in shaping Kapugedera's career. He was first picked in the national squad against India in November but pulled out of the tour with an injury. However, he made his ODI debut, aged just 18, against Australia in Perth in 2006, immediately impressing with his composure. \n\nESPNcricinfo Staff",

He began with a promising 54 on his ODI debut against Australia. His mannerisms while batting - particularly bow-legged stance and the flamboyant cover drives - immediately attracted comparisons with the great Aravinda de Silva. But despite being prodigiously talented, he failed to nail down a regular place during tours to Sharjah (1999), Zimbabwe (1999), Pakistan (2000) and England (2002). After the England tour he dropped out of the selectors' radar and returned to domestic cricket where he captained Panadura Cricket Club. Over the next four years he was a prolific run-scorer, especially after a move to Sebastianites for the 2004-05 season. Eventually he caught the eye of Tom Moody, who could not understand why he was not in the national squad. A quick promotion back into the Sri Lanka A team followed and after a successful tour to India he won a long overdue international recall. Still just 27, he was a surprise selection for the New Zealand tour and was handed his maiden cap in the first Test at Christchurch. It was an inauspicious start as he bagged a pair and Sri Lanka lost by five wickets. Sri Lanka's team management, however, kept faith for the second Test in Wellington and he rewarded them handsomely, scoring 61 in the first innings and a magnificent unbeaten 152 in the second. His maiden one-day century followed in India, just three weeks before the World Cup.\nCharlie Austin February 2007",

The tour to India with Sri Lanka A to participate in the Duleep trophy saw this elegant left-hand middle-order batsman blossom. He finished the three-match tournament with an aggregate of 421 runs, at 105.25, which included two successive undefeated centuries at Eden Gardens. An unbeaten 111 steered his team to the final of the tournament. He then compiled 149 not out in the final against the eventual winners, North Zone. Recognition did not follow immediately. He was overlooked for the tour of New Zealand that followed but continued to pile on the runs for Sri Lanka A. He was not at his best on the tour of the Caribbean when illness laid him low, but Warnapura was in outstanding form  in the home series against Bangladesh A that followed. He scored a career best 243 in the first unofficial Test at his home ground at Colts and followed it up with an unbeaten 104 in the second unofficial ODI to confirm that he could score runs in both forms of the game. His first strides into Test cricket - during the home series against Bangladesh in 2007 - were hardly auspicious, as he was dismissed off his first ball. He returned admirably in his second Test, scoring 82. He followed it up with a century against West Indies in Providence the following year and later made it to the Champions Trophy probables. ",

He learnt to play the game for St. Thomas' College in Matale at the age of 17, but he made rapid progress performing in provincial matches. When he came to Colombo he was selected as one of 15 probables by Daryl Foster, the Australian fast bowling coach, for the Sri Lanka Pace Academy headed by former Sri Lanka fast bowler Rumesh Ratnayake in 2000. Soon afterwards he was sent to the MRF Pace Academy in Chennai to further develop his skills. Playing for Moors SC since 2002 he bowled his club to the Premier league title in 2002-03 capturing 34 wickets (avg. 24.14) in 13 matches. But his career-best performance came the following season when he took a match haul of nine wickets against Colombo Cricket Club to steer Moors to a comprehensive ten-wicket win. He took the majority of his wickets bowling inswing and trapping the batsmen leg before. Welegedera toured Sharjah with the Sri Lanka Academy side and took seven wickets against UAE, which earned him selection for Sri Lanka A. But he suffered an ankle injury and had to be operated in Australia. The injury kept him out of cricket for 1 \u00bd years, but his Test debut finally arrived against England, in Galle, during the 2007-08 series. Often looked to as the leader of the pace attack, after it became apparent that Lasith Malinga would not return to Tests, Welegedara has had a mixed time at the top level. He improved considerably throughout 2011, and then turned in his best performance for Sri Lanka at the end of the year, as he took 5 wickets for 52 in the first innings in Durban, to help set up Sri Lanka's maiden Test win in South Africa. He has since been plagued by various injuries, and his absences have seen others make claims for the pace spearhead role in the past year. Sa'adi Thawfeeq and ESPNcricinfo staff July 2008",

In August 2019, he retired from all forms of cricket.[1]",
        "career": "Ajantha Mendis reintroduced mystery to spin in the era of video analysts and super-slow-motion replays. Much like the original mystery spinner, Jack Iverson, and the other practitioner of the \"Iversons\", John Gleeson, Mendis stunned the world with his finger-flicked legbreaks. His Iversons came with a new name, the \"carrom ball\", taken from the way the striker is flicked in the popular board game in the subcontinent.His first, most famous, and most comprehensive victims were the most prolific middle order of his time: Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman and Sourav Ganguly. Following closely on the heels of a six-for in the Asia Cup final against India's ODI side, Mendis made a sensational Test debut. He took eight wickets in his first Test and 26 in his first series, two more than Alec Bedser's record for a three-match debut series.The early success was built as much on his variations - offbreaks, topspinners, carrom balls, googlies, ones that did nothing - as it was on accuracy and Muttiah Muralitharan's company. As the mystery wore, though, much like with Iverson and Gleeson, the world caught up with him, and Mendis failed to live up to the early promise. By the time Murali retired, Mendis was not ready to take over as the leading Sri Lankan spinner, a vast change from when he could have emerged as the leading spinner in the world.Mendis continues to be an effective spinner in shorter formats where batsmen don't have much time to adjust. He holds the record for the best figures in a T20I innings, but fails to find a regular place in the Sri Lankan side for the longer formats. The rest of his career will be an exercise in trying to rediscover success, this time not through mystery but by being a really good spinner.Sidharth Monga ",

He is a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He has represented Sri Lanka in Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 cricket and played domestic cricket for the Sinhalese Sports Club and Basnahira North.[1]",
        "career": "A promising career with the national team looked certain when Dhammika Prasad took two wickets in as many balls in his first over of his ODI debut against Bangladesh in 2006. He went on to play two more matches before his career was cut short by a back injury which kept him out of the game for six months. Having recovered, he was selected for the Sri Lanka A tour to England in 2007 where he hoped to perform well and regain his place in the national team. What may have helped him in this quest was his ability to bowl at the death in ODIs, having worked hard to develop subtle variations including a good yorker. Consistent performances on the domestic front earned him a first Test cap against India in August 2008 as Sri Lanka sought to add pace to their attack. He did not disappoint, taking five wickets in the match, including the wicket of India's best batsman, Virender Sehwag, in both innings. Interestingly, Prasad started his cricket at De Mazenod College, Kandana, as a No.3 batsman. He played in this position till he reached 17 when he was forced to switch \nover to bowling fast because the school could not find anyone suitable to bowl with the new ball. He was selected for the Under-19 World Cup in 2002 and his performance paid off when he won a six-month scholarship to play in England. Prasad's best bowling effort was in the now-defunct provincial tournament when he took six wickets for 25 (match bag ten wickets) for Southern Province against Uva Province at the Galle International Stadium in 2004.

An occasional bowler who can deliver swinging match-winning spells, Mathews and Lasith Malinga holds the record for the highest ninth wicket partnership in ODI cricket.",
        "career": "A robust batting technique, nagging consistency with the ball, and athleticism in the field, all set off by an imperturbable temperament, have made Angelo Mathews one of Sri Lanka's most prized assets and a figure on which the team hangs many hopes. He has risen quickly since earning wide acclaim with an acrobatic save in the 2009 World Twenty20, and in February 2013, became Sri Lanka's youngest ever Test captain at 25, after having been groomed for the post for two years. In limited overs cricket, Mathews' all-round skills are almost indispensable. When he pulled a quad in the World Cup semi-final in 2011, he forced three changes to the XI that played in the final, as the team strove for the balance he single-handedly delivers. He began his international career with ambitions of becoming a genuine allrounder, but has since given primacy to his batting, and effectively plays as a specialist batter in the Test side. Often coming to the crease at No. 6, Mathews provides solidity to the lower-middle order, which had been a weakness for Sri Lanka prior to his arrival. In ODIs he has provided two unforgettable finishes - against Australia in 2010, and Pakistan in 2012 - stealing victory with a sublime, sustained assaults, but his best work has come in the Test format. In an outstanding 2014, in which he scored 1160 runs at an average of 77.33, Mathews' finest moment was the rousing 160 at Headingley, which transformed that match and saw Sri Lanka win their first Test series in England (not including the one-off Test in 1998). Mathews' appointment to the captaincy has heralded a renewed focus on youth and development by the Sri Lanka selectors. Once a successful leader of the St. Joseph's College side and the Sri Lanka Under-19 team, Mathews has been charged with ushering in a new age of Sri Lankan cricket.Andrew Fidel Fernando",

He plays first-class cricket for Sinhalese Sports Club. Suraj was educated at Rahula College Matara.[2][3][4] He is now working as a bus driver.[5]",
        "career": "A tall offspinner with gentle action, Suraj Randiv has eschewed the mystery balls many of his colleagues deal in and has instead forged a career reliant on flight, dip and, importantly, bounce. The topspinner and the arm ball are his only variations, and even his offbreak is not given to excessive turn. He had begun his career as a right-arm fast bowler at junior level, until his school found that they had no spinner in their Under-15 side and he was called on to fill the void. Starting as a part-time bowler, he was soon picking up wickets on a regular basis and started representing Matara SC while still at school. Twenty-three wickets in four matches in the U-23 tournament in 2003-04 did not go unnoticed by Marvan Atapattu and Mahela Jayawardene, who brought him over to SSC. He benefited immensely in the presence of Atapattu and Jayawardene, learning how to bowl under pressure and to different fields. He picked up 55 first-class wickets in 2005-06 but fell away in the next three seasons. However, he struck form again in 2008-09, taking 43 wickets and an injury to Murali before the Galle Test against Pakistan led to a national call-up, and made himself the Test side's second-choice spinner. Though a wonderful fielder and a handy lower order batsman, Randiv has not been able to nail down a place in the limited overs sides, perhaps other slow bowlers have been more committed to developing a wider variety of deliveries, which are more highly valued in the shorter formats. His position in the Test side has lately come under increasing pressure from a talented group of chasing spinners, led by Tharindu  Kaushal.\nSaadi Thawfeeq and ESPNcricinfo staff ",

What impressed the coaches about Lakmal was his height and ability to get bounce and swing at a tender age. Despite his natural ability, Lakmal had one big deficiency in that he lacked the stamina to bowl long spells and on occasions he did, he regularly fell ill. The lack of nutrition was quite common with fast bowlers coming from outside Colombo and soon after Lakmal was inducted into the academy, the coaches worked on developing his stamina. Good performances with Sri Lanka A saw him break into the national ODI side. He was one of three players marked for the future by Chandika Hathurusingha in 2008 when he coached the A side.

He also captained the team in limited-overs formats.[1] Domestically he plays for Sri Lanka Army Sports Club in the Premier Trophy and Premier Limited-Overs Tournament, and the Jaffna Stallions in the Lanka Premier League. Perera has played franchise T20 cricket all around the world for numerous leagues. Primarily a bowling all-rounder, he is an aggressive left-handed batsman who can hit big sixes in death overs and is a useful right-arm medium-fast bowler.",
        "career": "A bustling right-arm seamer and sporadically effective left-handed hitter, Thisara Perera has been been in Sri Lanka's short-format sides since 2010. Bowling is ostensibly Perera's major skill but, often deployed in the lower-middle order, he is also capable of delivering furious finishes to an innings. Perera is particularly severe on spin, which has led to his being used as a pinch-hitter through the middle overs, but he has at times also been weak to quality pace bowling. He is the kind of player for whom form in one discipline usually bleeds into the other. Dropped for the limited-overs series against South Africa in July 2014, but roared back in the following ODI series against Pakistan, getting his bowling and his hitting in order. He struck 78 runs at a rate of 169.56 and claimed a series-high nine wickets at an average of 10.66. Perera has also done well with bat and ball on previous tours to Australia, and has often been at his best against India, memorably slamming the straight six that completed Sri Lanka's World T20 triumph in 2014. His more recent years have been beset by inconsistency but Perera continues to command a place in the side. He has hat-tricks in both ODIs and T20s.Perera began his schooling at St Anthony's, Wattala, before accepting a scholarship to join St Joseph's College. It turned out to be a productive move as he teamed up with Angelo Mathews and produced many noteworthy performances in the thriving schools cricket scene. Perera played a key role in helping his school break the hoodoo in the Battle of the Saints (against St Peters College) that lasted more than 35 years. He received his maiden national call-up during Sri Lanka's tour of India in 2009 as an emergency replacement for Mathews. That quickly led to an IPL contract, as he was bought by Chennai Super Kings for $50,000, and he has been one of the few Sri Lanka players to consistently find employment in the competition.\nAndrew Fidel Fernando",

An opener by reputation, Thirimanne made his debut in early 2010 and earnt sporadic places in the national side over the next two years, but it was not until he was moved to the middle order in 2012 that he unearthed the consistency that would make him a regular at the top level. A measured batsman, if at times a limited one, Thirimanne has been a contrasting ally for Sri Lanka's middle-order dashers in ODI cricket, striking particularly memorable partnerships with Angelo Mathews to lift Sri Lanka out of trouble.His forte has always been the longest form however, as evidenced by a first-class average of almost 60 in his first full season for Ragama CC. Thirimanne could not recreate that form in his first few Tests as an opener, but conjured his finest innings to date at no. 4, when he stepped off a plane 36 hours before the 2013 New Year Test to strike a sparkling 91 on the first day in Sydney. Ten days later he hit a maiden international hundred in an ODI to take Sri Lanka to victory in Adelaide.  Andrew Fernando ",

An even more memorable dismissal followed, when Ricky Ponting failed to read his slower ball and pushed back a return catch.  He then made his Test debut against the same opposition, and became only the second Sri Lankan bowler to strike with his very first delivery, when he dismissed Shane Watson. He was laid low by a nerve-related back injury soon after his arrival at international cricket, but after nine months on the sidelines returned to the national side to take a wicket in his first over in Twenty20 internationals, completing an unprecedented treble. He has since made himself a mainstay in the Test attack, and despite his inexperience, is often called to spearhead the pacemen, when Chanaka Welegedara is absent through injury.Eranga was discovered at an all-island pace bowling competition in 2006 by former Sri Lanka medium pacer Champaka Ramanayake and Anusha Samaranayake. Their discovery led to his being picked for the Chilaw Marians and eventually the division-one premier league tournament, which in turn led to a place in the Sri Lanka development squad.

        "career": "A collected right-hand batsman with a firm technique, Kaushal Silva churned out hundred after hundred in first-class cricket until the sheer volume in his output could no longer be ignored by the national selectors. His erstwhile omission had largely been because of the surfeit of wicketkeepers in Sri Lanka's Test squad. He had perhaps made enough runs to vindicate place on his batting alone, but the nuances of balancing a side and the quest to groom young batsmen for the future had kept a Test spot out of reach.Silva's voracious first-class appetite was finally rewarded when Tillakaratne Dilshan's retirement made an opening spot available in the Test XI. Silva had hit 27 first-class tons by the time he was granted an extended run in the side, and that in a position where he has not often batted in domestic cricket.His grit and determination were evident in his tour of the UAE in January 2014, where he made two important scores of over 80 and a 95 against Pakistan. Equally encouraging has been the energy and enthusiasm he has brought to the team - perhaps virtues that sustained him during the long stretches knocking on the selectors' door. A maiden Test ton in Dhaka shortly after the UAE series added force to the notion that he could consistently bring stability to the top order.Silva had played three Tests, largely as a fill-in wicketkeeper, in 2011, but was unable to capitalise on those chances. His cricket-coach father is said to have been a key influence on his cricket - something he shares with Kumar Sangakkara, who had been among Silva's champions before his emergence at the top level.In April 2016, he suffered a mild concussion when he was hit on the head while fielding at short leg in a practice game in the lead up to Sri Lanka's season. He was airlifted to a Colombo hospital as a precautionary measure, before being given a clean bill of health a couple of days later.\nAndrew Fidel Fernando",

His approach to the game is more suitable for the one-day and T20 formats where he has excelled in domestic matches. In 2010 he hit a whirlwind 43 off 15 balls against Basnahira North in the inter-provincial T20 match and captured four wickets for 26 with his nippy deliveries to help Ruhuna convert a losing cause into a winning one.  Kulasekara first began as a swimmer and won third place in the all-island swimming championships and cricket was only his second love. At Vidyartha College, Kandy he learnt his cricket and showed so much promise that he was selected to captain the Central Province Under-17 and U-19 teams. He was eventually selected to play for Sri Lanka in the U-19 World Cup in 2004 where he won two Man-of-the-Match awards for his all-round ability. After joining NCC, he was coached by former Sri Lanka cricketers Romesh Kaluwitharana and Chandika Hathurusingha who helped improve his batting technique.

        "career": "Dinesh Chandimal is among the most promising young batsman going around in Sri Lankan cricket. A technically sound batsman with strokes all around the wicket, Chandimal also stands out because of the maturity he shows at the crease and his temperament to build and pace an innings.He made his international debut when only 21, and impressed almost immediately, scoring 111 in his second ODI, against India in the 2010 triangular series in Zimbabwe. Four innings later, he made another century, this time against England at Lord's, but his stocks rose significantly in 2012, when he performed superbly in ODIs on successive tours to South Africa and Australia. In conditions he wouldn't have been used to, Chandimal occupied the crucial No.4 slot and revelled in the responsibility, scoring consistently. In 16 ODI innings in those two series, he aggregated 630 runs, including six fifties. He was equally impressive on his Test debut too, scoring fifties in each innings in Durban as Sri Lanka won their first Test in South Africa. A dip in his limited overs form, especially at home, saw Chandimal dropped from the side during the latter half of 2012, though he remained in the Sri Lanka squad for all three formats. He returned to the Test side at the SCG for the New Year Test, and hit an unbeaten 67, batting alongside the tail. Six weeks later he became Sri Lanka's youngest ever captain, at 23, when he was handed the reins of Sri Lanka's top-ranked Twenty20, and was also named Angelo Mathews' deputy in Tests and ODIs. He celebrated his elevation with back-to-back Test hundreds against Bangladesh at home. Chandimal's rise to the national team came after consistent performances with bat and gloves at age-level cricket. That included an attacking century against India Under-19s in August 2007 and an unbeaten 112 in the tri-nation series against England U-19s the following year earned him a call-up to the squad for the U-19 World Cup in Malaysia in 2008.Shortly after completing a prolific season for Colombo's Ananda College, Chandimal was invited to join Nondescripts Cricket Club by Kumar Sangakkara. Chandimal was only 19 when scored his maiden first-class century against New Zealand in 2009, representing a Sri Lanka Cricket Development XI in two three-day practice matches against the likes of Chris Martin, Darryl Tuffey, Ian O'Brien, Jacob Oram and Daniel Vettori. He was among the leading run-getters in Sri Lanka's Interprovincial Twenty20 competition, and won a call-up to the national side for the ICC World Twenty20 in 2010. Soon after, the international opportunities followed, and Chandimal has made the most of them.\nSa'adi Thawfeeq and ESPNcricinfo staff",

Karunaratne made his first class debut for Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) in 2008, but had a quiet first season, batting largely in the middle order. He secured a place in the top order in 2009, and began to score more consistently thereafter.

His prolific form earnt him a call-up for the Sri Lanka A team against visiting South Africa A, where he again impressed, making 184 against an attack that included Vernon Philander. Karunaratne has not reproduced the same volume of runs since his second season, but has developed a reputation for making big centuries against good attacks. He played two ODIs for Sri Lanka in 2011, making 4 and 60, and was also included in the Test tour to South Africa later in the year, though he did not get a game. He toured South Africa again in July 2012 though, with the A team, and impressed with scores of 83 and 150 not out on that tour. Soon after that, he found himself on the verge of a Test debut when he was chosen to open alongside SSC partner Tharanga Paranavitana, replacing the injured Tillakaratne Dilshan for the Test against New Zealand in Galle.Andrew Fernando",

        "career": "Sachithra Senanayake is an offspinner who made his international debut for Sri Lanka in the fourth ODI in the series against South Africa in 2011-12. At the time of making his international debut, Senanayake had already taken 297 first-class wickets from 59 matches at a fantastic average of 20.50, and 107 List A wickets at an economy rate of 3.90. In the 2010-11 season, he was the fourth-highest wicket-taker in Tier A of the Premier League tournament, taking 45 wickets in eight matches at 15.17. He has also shown that he can handle the pressure of limited-over matches: in the 2011-12 Premier Limited-Over tournament, Sri Lanka's main one-day competition, he was the highest wicket-taker with 16 in six games at 11.18.Senanayake's first foray into international cricket was short-lived though, and after several mediocre performances, he was released back into the domestic fold, where he continued to excel. He came back into international focus when he was bought for $650,000 by the Kolkata Knight Riders IPL franchise in 2013, largely owing to his reputation of possessing one of the better carrom balls in Sri Lanka. It turned out to be a good year for him, as he also put in a strong showing in the first-class competition, made a Test debut for Sri Lanka against Pakistan in December, and also had an extended run in the one-day team. He had mixed fortunes in the ODI series against England in June 2014 - remarkable figures of 4 for 13 that skittled England out for 99 were offset by news of his action being reported as suspect. While the controversy didn't stop him from being at the centre of a tense series win for Sri Lanka - he was also involved in a Mankading incident against Jos Buttler in the decider - he was dealt a big blow when his action was found to be illegal in July.  Senanayake remodeled his action and returned to international cricket in December 2014. ESPNcricinfo staff",

It was with the bat that he made his first impression in Tests: Perera came within five runs of scoring a century on debut, against Pakistan at Sharjah, but he asserted himself as a bowler soon enough. His second-innings five-wicket haul helped wipe Bangladesh out in Dhaka, less than two weeks later.No big turner of the ball, and possessing only an arm ball as a variation, Perera's strengths lie in accuracy and persistence.  He has honed those skills by practicing spot-bowling intensively, on the advice of Muttiah Muralitharan, one of Perera's idols, alongside Saqlain Mushtaq. In his time in the Test side, Perera has proved a good fit for the attack's ethos of squeezing wickets from the opposition, and he has also been a fine partner for Rangana Herath when the two bowl from opposite ends.Perera had made rapid progress since starting his career at Sri Sumangala College, Panadura. He toured Australia with the Sri Lanka Under-19 team and, after he made his first-class debut for Panadura Sports Club, was drafted into the A side in 2001. He played one season for Chilaw Marians Cricket Club and holds the bowling record for the Under-23s with 55 wickets from seven matches in 2004.He had had some success in A team tours to England and Zimbabwe with both bat and ball, but continued to develop as a bowler through his time at Sri Lanka's Spin Bowling Academy, where he was coached by former offspinners Ashley Mallett and Ruwan Kalpage.In limited-overs cricket, Perera earned a call-up to Sri Lanka's squad for the ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa after Muralitharan was ruled out due to injury.

He plays all forms of the game for the Sri Lanka national cricket team, and currently one of the permanent middle order batsman in all formats. He was a key member of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 winning team. In domestic cricket, he plays for the Wayamba cricket team.[1]",
        "career": "Possessed of a short backlift, powerful forearms and relentless bloody-mindedness, left-handed batsman Kusal Janith Perera's batting is not just inspired by his hero Sanath Jayasuriya's technique, at times, it seems an exact duplicate. Like Jayasuriya, he has a second skill - though it is wicketkeeping rather than slow left-arm, and he was part of Sri Lanka's Under-19 teams, before he joined Colts Cricket Club as a senior. At Colts, Perera quickly set about forging a career founded on aggression and reliability in equal parts, and after two seasons, Sri Lanka's selectors could no longer ignore him. An injury to Kumar Sangakkara saw him earn a place in Sri Lanka's limited-overs squad to Australia in January 2012, where his breezy innings made plain his talent - particularly during a 22 not out at the Gabba that took Sri Lanka home in a low-scoring ODI.  Though a middle-order batsman by reputation, he was promoted to the position of opener in the two Twenty20s that followed, where he continued to play impactful inningsOn return to Sri Lanka, Perera hit a first-class double-ton, then a 275-ball 336, and had proved enough to the selectors to be given a central contract and an extended run in the limited-overs sides.Perera hit his maiden ODI century in Mirpur in 2014 to help Sri Lanka complete a 3-0 whitewash over Bangladesh. He then hammered a 17-ball half-century, Sri Lanka's joint-fastest, against Pakistan in Pallekele in July 2015, to equal Jayasuriya's record.A month later Perera was handed his Test debut against India in Colombo. He made twin fifties, becoming only the second Sri Lanka batsman to score two half-centuries on debut.Perera's burgeoning career hit a stumbling block in December 2015 when he was provisionally suspended from international cricket by the ICC, after having failed a dope test. He was recalled from Sri Lanka's tour of New Zealand and subsequently missed a bilateral T20 series in India, Asia Cup, and World T20.His plight appeared bleak when his initial sample tested positive for the performance-enhancing drug, 19-Norandrostenedione, but it grew bleaker when his B sample returned identical results.Perera had strong support from SLC, though, and also spent a substantial amount of his own money in fighting the WADA-approved lab's findings. His campaign to be cleared included a trip to England for a polygraph test, a hair analysis and a separate urine test, as well as substantial coordination with his main legal team, which was based in the UK. All this eventually paid off when his name was cleared in May 2016, bringing his suspension to an end after five months out - the Qatar-based lab's findings were deemed \"unsustainable\" for \"scientific and technical reasons\" by an independent expert hired by the ICC.ESPNcricinfo staff",

Outstanding form in the 2015 Premier League Tournament prompted his elevation. He was the first-class season's top scorer with 1144 runs at an average of 67.29, and had also claimed 20 wickets for Badureliya Cricket Club. Siriwardana showcased his attacking flair when he made his ODI and T20 debuts during Pakistan's mid-year tour of Sri Lanka, and memorably struck his first international fifty in 25 deliveries during a breakneck 114-run ODI stand with Angelo Mathews. A successful initiation in those formats paved the route to his Test debut against West Indies later the same year. He had made his first-class debut for Sebastianites Cricket and Athletic Club in 2005, and had played for Sri Lanka A for several years before getting his international break. Siriwardana came close to national recognition was when he was included in the 30-member provisional squad for the 2009 World T20, but he was left out of the final team. That call-up came close on the heels of his maiden first-class ton, 135 for Basnahira South against Ruhuna in the SLC Inter-Provincial Tournament, a match in which he also claimed five wickets.Andrew Fidel Fernando",

In November 2017, he was named the One Day International (ODI) batsman of the year for the 2016\u201317 season at Sri Lanka Cricket's annual awards.[2]",
        "career": "Blessed with a compact technique, an aggressive impulse, and an iron resolve, Kusal Mendis rose rapidly through the age-group system, and quickly became one of the most promising young batsmen in the world. He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. A highly-rated graduate of Sri Lanka's school cricket system, Mendis' batting had earned him a large following long before he was on the national selectors' radar. As wicketkeeper and flowing right-hand batsman, Mendis won the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 2013, for his work in the Prince of Wales College team. He was Sri Lanka's under-19 captain in the Youth World Cup the following year.Mendis began his first-class career for Bloomfield Cricket Club in the Premier League Tournament of 2015. He had a middling first season, hitting 459 runs at an average of 30.60, but continued to be followed closely as Sri Lanka moved to flood their Test team with youth. It was Mendis' excellent returns in the Moin-ud-Dowlah three-day tournament in Hyderabad that paved his route to the national team. He was named in the squad to play West Indies in October 2015, and made his debut in the second match of that series.Andrew Fidel Fernando",

That innings was followed by a run of three fifties and a maiden hundred in the ODI series against Zimbabwe, cue a call-up to the Test side. The Test debut was a disappointment, Gunathilaka scoring 16 and 2 before falling to loose strokes in both innings.Strong square of the wicket, particularly on the off side, Gunathilaka, who admires Kumar Sangakkara, is also a part-time offspinner.

        "career": "A canny left-arm spinner with dangerous variations, Malinda Pushpakumara has been Sri Lanka's most prolific domestic wicket-taker of recent years. First-class tracks on the island are stacked heavily in favour of spinners, but even so, it is Pushpakumara's consistency that makes him stand out. He was the Premier League Tournament's top wicket-taker in the 2012-13 and 2014-15 tournaments, and was among the best again in the years in between. But 2016-17 was his best tournament of the lot: at an average of 13.79, Pushpakumara claimed 77 scalps - 20 more than his nearest competitor. With that tally, he finally forced himself into a Sri Lanka Test squad, at the age of 29 and with 558 first-class wickets to his name. The delay in his being chosen for the top level perhaps also has to do with Rangana Herath's presence in the team - the selectors believing only on left-arm spinner necessary.Having begun his career in Lumbini College, Colombo, Pushpakumara had also played for Sri Lanka's Under-19 side in 2005, in a triangular tournament featuring England and Bangladesh. Later, after coming of age at the first-class level, he also played for Sri Lanka A with some success, against the likes of South Africa A, New Zealand A and West Indies A.Andrew Fidel Fernando",

Having begun his cricket at Colombo's Thurstan College, Samarawickrama moved to St Joseph's in his final years, and prospered in the school system, even hitting a memorable 126 in St Joseph's biggest fixture of the year. That performance propelled him into Sri Lanka's Under-19 squad, where he again impressed, making 265 runs at an average of 44.17 in the 2014 Youth World Cup. While Kusal Mendis - his team-mate from that U-19 side - was fast-tracked to the national side, Samarawickrama would have to earn his place through first-class performances.

When he followed that up with 314 runs at 62.80 for Sri Lanka A in England, he was called up to the Test squad. Had it been any other series, Silva may have made his debut, only he had been selected for the series in which Sri Lanka would whitewash Australia 3-0 - the selectors saw no need to make changes to the batting order.
